## SFML Ball Simulation

A simple C++ program that simulates the movement and collisions of multiple circles (balls) within a fullscreen window using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This simulation includes basic physics concepts like gravity, air resistance, and elastic collisions with both walls and other balls, giving a rudimentary visual representation of a kinetic gas model, where the average speed is related to a simulated "temperature."

## Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you will need:

- A C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, Clang, MSVC).
- The SFML Library.
- A working arial.ttf font file in the same directory as the executable

##  Installation (Linux/macOS - using g++)

Run:

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o balls -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lm
